## UX

### Colour Scheme

- `#ff0000` used for section backgrounds, buttons and headings texts.
- `#ffffff` used for section backgrounds and text on `#ff0000` backgrounds.
- `#212529` used for text color on `#ffffff` backgrounds.

### Typography

- I used 'Rubik'-Font from [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for headings and the brands logo.
- I used the 'Bootstrap Native Font Stack' for optimum text rendering on every device and OS. [Read more here!](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/content/reboot/#native-font-stack)
- [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.
