## About

New York Cola is the soft drink for New York locals, fans of the city and tourists. In the city that never sleeps, you need caffeine and refreshment. In this online store you can experience the brand, take part in a competition and buy the products. Enjoy it and taste the city.

## UX

### Colour Scheme

- `#ff0000` used for section backgrounds, buttons and headings texts.
- `#ffffff` used for section backgrounds and text on `#ff0000` backgrounds.
- `#212529` used for text color on `#ffffff` backgrounds.

### Typography

- I used 'Rubik'-Font from [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for headings and the brands logo.
- I used the 'Bootstrap Native Font Stack' for optimum text rendering on every device and OS. [Read more here!](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/content/reboot/#native-font-stack)
- [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.
