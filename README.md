## UX

### Colour Scheme

- `#ff0000` used for section backgrounds, buttons and headings texts.
- `#ffffff` used for section backgrounds and text on `#ff0000` backgrounds.
- `#212529` used for text color on `#ffffff` backgrounds.

### Typography

- I used 'Rubik'-Font from [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for headings and the brands logo.
- I used the 'Bootstrap Native Font Stack' for optimum text rendering on every device and OS. [Read more here!](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/content/reboot/#native-font-stack)
- [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Database Design

I have used `pygraphviz` and `django-extensions` to auto-generate an ERD.

The steps taken were as follows:
- In the terminal: `sudo apt update`
- then: `sudo apt-get install python3-dev graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config`
- then type `Y` to proceed
- then: `pip3 install django-extensions pygraphviz`
- in my `settings.py` file, I added the following to my `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_extensions',
    ...
]
```
- back in the terminal: `python3 manage.py graph_models -a -o erd.png`
- dragged the new `erd.png` file into my `documentation/` folder
- removed `'django_extensions',` from my `INSTALLED_APPS`
- finally, in the terminal: `pip3 uninstall django-extensions pygraphviz -y`

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/firstnamejonas/newyork-cola/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project.
It isn't a specialized tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it can be made to work.

Through it, user stories, issues, and milestone tasks were planned, then tracked on a weekly basis using the basic Kanban board.

![screenshot](documentation/gh-projects.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/firstnamejonas/newyork-cola/issues) served as an another Agile tool.
There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories.

It also helped with milestone iterations on a weekly basis.

- [Open Issues](https://github.com/firstnamejonas/newyork-cola/issues) [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/firstnamejonas/newyork-cola)](https://github.com/firstnamejonas/newyork-cola/issues)

- [Closed Issues](https://github.com/firstnamejonas/newyork-cola/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) [![GitHub closed issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/firstnamejonas/newyork-cola)](https://github.com/firstnamejonas/newyork-cola/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into stories prior to prioritizing and implementing them.
Using this approach, I was able to apply the MoSCow prioritization and labels to my user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration

## Ecommerce Business Model

This site sells goods to individual customers, and therefore follows a `Business to Customer` model. It is of the simplest **B2C** forms, as it focuses on individual transactions, and doesn't need anything such as monthly/annual subscriptions.

It is still in its early development stages, although it already has a newsletter, and links for social media marketing.

Social media can potentially build a community of users around the business, and boost site visitor numbers, especially when using larger platforms such as Facebook, Instagram or TikTok.

A newsletter list can be used by the business to send regular messages to site users. For example, what items are on special offer, new items in stock, updates to business hours, notifications of events, and much more!

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO) & Social Media Marketing

### Keywords

I've identified some appropriate keywords to align with my site, that should help users
when searching online to find my page easily from a search engine.
This included a series of the following keyword types

| Keyword Length | Topic: New York Souvenirs | Topic: New York Gifts | Topic: New York | Topic: Cola |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Short-Tail Keywords | - | - | - | - |
|  | New York Souvenir | New York Gifts | New York | Cola |
|  | NYC Souvenir | NYC Presents | NYC | Coca Cola |
|  | NYC Memories | Gift Shop New York | New York Life | Softdrink |
|  | New York Sights | NYC Gifts | NYC Locals | Caffeine Drink |
| Long-Tail Keywords | - | - | - | - |
|  | Unique New York City Souvenirs | High-Quality New York City Gifts | Explore New York City Attractions | Classic Cola Flavors |
|  | Best NYC Souvenirs to Buy | Exclusive NYC Gift Ideas | Discover Hidden Gems of NYC | Top-rated Softdrinks Brands |
|  | New York Souvenir Shops | Unique New York City Souvenirs for Him/Her | Best Things to Do in NYC | Zero Sugar Softdrinks |
|  | Best New York Souvenir | New York themed gifts | Sights in NYC | Top Cola Brands in the world |
|  | Trendy New York City Souvenirs | Gifts from New York | Local Businesses New York City | Zero Sugar Cola |

I also played around with [Word Tracker](https://www.wordtracker.com) a bit to check the frequency of some of my site's primary keywords (only until the free trial expired).
